You'll have to fight against their army of cards with an army of our own. You will be sending our forces into battle turn after turn and whoever is mightier will win. In the event of a stalemate you'll have to send three waves of reinforcements and follow it up by a single winner take all showdown.  If you do enough damage the the forces from Beyclic Scard we'll win!</p>

                <li>Each turn you and the computer will both play a card.</li>
                <li>Whoever has a higher card (Ace high) will win that turn and collect the played cards into their pile.</li>
                <li>In the event of a draw, three aditional cards will be played face down followed by one face up card.  The player with the higher card collects the pile of all 10 cards.</li>

                <li>At any time, the player can call a cease-fire and make peace.  This will result in no winner as there are truly no winners in war.</li>
